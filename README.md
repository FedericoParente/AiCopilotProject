# AI Copilot for Project Management

**Fully Compliant with the Model Context Protocol (MCP)**

---

## 🎯 Objectives

1. Deliver **context-aware AI assistance** for comprehensive project lifecycle management, including task creation, dependency mapping, scheduling, and risk assessment.
2. Seamlessly integrate with enterprise-grade systems such as **GitHub, Jira, and Slack** for real-time synchronization of deliverables and development artifacts.
3. Provide **interactive, dual-mode visualizations** (Gantt chart and Kanban board) for project oversight.
4. Ensure architectural compatibility with **large language models (LLMs)** through a robust, MCP-compliant contextual infrastructure.
5. Implement **role-based access control (RBAC)** with granular permission schemes suitable for enterprise deployment.
6. Design a responsive, high-performance **multi-user UI layer** optimized for collaborative environments.

## 🧱 Technical Architecture

### Frontend

* **Technology Stack:** React with TypeScript
* **UI Libraries:** Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, React Flow, React Gantt
* **State Management:** Zustand
* **Contextual Memory Layer:** Local context graph supporting persistent MCP resource identifiers

### Backend

* **API Layer:** FastAPI or Node.js (Express/Koa)
* **Data Layer:** PostgreSQL for relational data; Redis for caching and session handling
* **MCP Resource Provider:**

  * RESTful endpoints (`/context`, `/resources`, `/events`)
  * All entities represented as MCP-compliant JSON-LD schemas

### LLM Integration Layer

* **Adapter (LLM ↔ MCP):** Facilitates semantic grounding via resource retrieval and prompt context injection
* **LLM Framework Compatibility:** Plug-and-play with orchestration engines such as **LangChain** and **Semantic Kernel**

### DevOps and Monitoring

* **Containerization:** Docker (multi-service architecture)
* **CI/CD:** GitLab Pipelines
* **Observability:** Loki (logs), Grafana (dashboards)

## 🧠 MCP Resource Schemas

### Project

* `id`, `name`, `created`, `deadline`, `owner`, `members`

### Task

* `id`, `name`, `description`, `status`, `assignedTo`, `dependencies[]`, `contextProject`

### User

* `id`, `email`, `name`, `role`

### Message

* `id`, `sender`, `content`, `linkedTaskId`, `timestamp`

## 🧩 Core Functional Modules

### ✍️ Conversational Copilot

* Natural language interface for creating and managing tasks/projects
* Grounded response generation using MCP resource context
* Supported commands:

  * "Initialize a mobile app development project..."
  * "Identify tasks stalled in code review"
  * "Assign task X to user Y"
  * "Generate a weekly project summary"

### 📊 Visual Interfaces

#### Gantt Chart

* Interactive timeline editing (start/end dates)
* Automated dependency detection
* Dynamic zoom, snapping, and scroll support

#### Kanban Board

* Configurable status columns
* Interactive task cards with assignment, tagging, and metadata display

### 🔁 Third-Party Integrations

* **GitHub:** Bi-directional sync of issues, PRs, and commit references
* **Jira:** Task import/export and update mapping
* **Slack:** Notifications and command interface via chat hooks

### 🔐 Security Architecture

* JWT-based authentication with optional 2FA
* Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with inheritance and scoped visibility
* Comprehensive audit logging tied to MCP resources and events

---

## 🧪 Testing & Validation

* **End-to-End Testing:** Playwright
* **Backend Coverage:** Unit and integration tests for APIs and LLM adapter
* **Performance Testing:** Gantt rendering stress tests with >1000 concurrent tasks

---

## 🔮 Future Extensions

* Persistent vector memory (e.g., **Weaviate**, **Qdrant**)
* Voice interface support (STT/TTS)
* Monte Carlo simulation engine for project risk forecasting
* Modular plugin architecture for custom task types and workflows

---

## 🚀 MVP Deliverables

1. React-based frontend with integrated Chat, Gantt, and Kanban views
2. RESTful backend exposing MCP-compliant resource schemas and endpoints
3. LLM ↔ MCP adapter for contextual grounding and semantic resolution
4. GitHub integration supporting live data sync
5. Full RBAC implementation with comprehensive audit logging
